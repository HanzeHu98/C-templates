# A Doubly Linked List Implementation in C
**Name**: Hanze HU 

## Specifications
A simple linkedList implementation that reads from a graph text input and stores all information inside nodes in a doubly linked list

## Implemented Functions
Currently supports the creation and freeing of a linked list struct. You can also print all elements in the linked list sequencially, as well as append to the end of the linked list and delete a given node in the linked list.

## Compiling and running
Simply compile the linkedList.c file and run it, it will read from the input graph0 and print the results for all elements in the graph by going through the linked list.

## Valgrind Report
Valgrind report ran clean on the compiled executable reading from graph 0.
